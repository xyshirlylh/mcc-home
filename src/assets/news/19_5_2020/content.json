    "contentCN": "2020年5月19日，正在积极准备6月复工的中冶新加坡再迎捷报，中标Short Street从肃街酒店工程总承包项目。继拿下万礼热带雨林公园南北区设计施工总承包项目，挑战生态主题公园设计施工，中冶新加坡再次在当地建筑市场上开拓了全新领域。\n\nShort Street从肃街酒店项目占地面积2251平方米，建筑面积11160平方米，地下一层，地上十四层，共计有528间客房。该项目的挑战性在于场地狭小，需先拆后建，整个工期非常紧，距离最近的周边建筑物只有1米的距离，对施工场地布置和整个施工流程的管理要求很高。再加上周边环境复杂，紧邻地铁线路，距离文物保护区只有5至6米，基坑开挖的施工方案，不但需要考虑对地铁隧道变形的影响，而且要兼顾对周边的文物的保护。\n\n中冶新加坡以其过往项目中在地铁线路周边施工的丰富经验，以及投标方案中提出对可能发生碰撞的桩基础的细致分析和相应的处理意见，赢得了业主方的肯定。此外，该项目要求整个项目从拆除到建成，总工期15个月。投标组在认真研究了整个项目各个流程需要时间后，发现按照现有的建筑结构形式，采用传统的施工方法是无法满足投标时间要求的。因此，在投标中提交了两种施工方案，供业主方选择：一种以现有图纸为基础，经济合理，但施工工期较长，另一种对整个项目的结构形式进行了修改，改为施工速度更快的钢结构，并且考虑在地基基础施工上采用逆作法，满足工期要求。最终，中冶新加坡凭借丰富的施工经验和出色的问题解决能力拔得头筹，成功中标。",
    "content": "On 19 May 2020, MCC Singapore, which was preparing for the resumption of construction in June, won the EPC contract for the Short Street Hotel project. MCC Singapore has once again broken new ground in the local construction market after winning the design and build contract for the Mandai Tropical Rainforest Park project.\n\nThe Short Street Hotel project covers an area of 2251 square meters, with a construction area of 11160 square meters, one basement level, 14 floors above ground, and a total of 528 guest rooms. The project was challenging due to the site's limited space which required demolition before construction, as well as the tight construction schedule. With the nearest building only one meter away, it required a high level of management for the site layout and the overall construction process. Besides, the complex surrounding and environment of the project, located near the MRT line and only five to six meters away from the heritage conservation area, raises new challenges. The construction plan for the excavation of the pit not only has to consider the impact on the deformation of the MRT tunnel, but also the protection of the surrounding heritage.\n\nMCC Singapore's extensive experience in working around MRT lines in previous projects, as well as the detailed analysis of the pile foundations and the corresponding treatment of possible collisions proposed in the tender scheme, won the client's approval. In addition, the project required a total construction period of 15 months for the entire project, from demolition to completion. After carefully studying the time required for each process of the entire project, the bidding team found that according to the existing structural form of the building, traditional construction methods could not meet the bidding time requirements. As a result, two construction options were submitted in the tender for the owner's choice: one based on the existing drawings, which was economical and reasonable but had a longer construction period while the other modified the structural form of the project and replaced it with a steel structure that could be constructed faster. The latter option considered the use of reverse engineering in the construction of the foundation to meet the schedule requirements. Ultimately, MCC Singapore won the tender by virtue of its rich construction experience and excellent problem-solving ability.\n\nChen Luning,\nMCC Singapore"
