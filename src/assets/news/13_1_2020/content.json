"content":"On January 13, 2020, MCC Singapore successfully won the bid for the Singapore Mandai Tropical Rainforest Park project. This is MCC Singapore's second major project relating to Singapore's tourism industry following the Universal Studios Singapore project.\n\nThe Mandai Rainforest Park is a new park in the Mandai Project, adjacent to the new Bird Park, Singapore Night Safari, Singapore Zoo, Singapore River Safari, and Mandai eco-resort, forming a complete eco-experience park and providing the public and tourists with opportunities to get closer to nature while also serving as a place for leisure and entertainment. The completed Mandai Project is expected to provide a major boost to Singapore's tourism industry, doubling the number of annual visitors to 10 million and creating more jobs in Singapore.\n\nTen years ago, in 2010, MCC Singapore completed the Universal Studios Singapore project with breath-taking speed and quality. Today, ten years later, MCC Singapore has once again taken on the responsibility of designing and constructing the Mandai Rainforest Park, demonstrating the industry's trust and recognition of MCC Singapore's strength in the design and construction of theme park projects. \n\nMCC Singapore\nChen Luning"
