"content":"On 11 October 2019, MCC Land successfully wins the tender for the Canberra Link Executive Condominium project. The project is located in the northern part of Singapore, in Sembawang District, District 27, with a land area of 16,690 square meters, 2.3 plot ratio, a 99-year land lease, with an estimated number of 450 residential units that can be built. The construction period of the project does not exceed five years, with the building height between 45 meters and 55 meters above sea level.\n\nLocation of the Canberra Link EC project\n\nThe Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), in its blueprint for Master Plan 2014, proposed plans to create new facilities and spaces in the Sembawang District to meet the vision of community development and gradually transform Sembawang into a vibrant town to meet the needs of its residents. There are still many vacant lots in the vicinity of the site, but they are within the Singapore Government's planning parameters, in which three educational institutions are proposed while the remaining vacant lots are mostly high-rise residential properties. The plot to the east of the Canberra Link EC project site was sold in September 2019 at S$558 per square foot and 550 residential units are expected to be built.\n\nIt is also commendable that our company's bid exceeded the second-highest bid by a mere $0.95 per square feet, which demonstrated the company's astute judgment and understanding of the market. The EC site at Canberra Link is the fifth site that the company has acquired in the northern part of Singapore. As always, MCC Singapore will continue to fulfill our mission \"Transforming Lives, Inspiring Society,\" creating more beautiful homes for the urban city of Singapore.\n\nMCC Singapore\nXin Yan"}
