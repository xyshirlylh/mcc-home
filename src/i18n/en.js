Just as how \"the bright moon never separates two places in its embrace,\" the virtual celebration connected MCC employees in China, Singapore, Cambodia, and Indonesia as we come together to celebrate and join in on the festivities while simultaneously promoting Chinese culture.\n\nAs the event commenced, all employees of MCC Singapore jointly watched the festive greetings and messages from Zhu Jianguo, General Manager of MCC Central Research Institute of Building and Construction (MCC CRIBC), as well as from other leaders and colleagues of MCC CRIBC in Beijing. While extending holiday wishes to the employees and their families, General Manager Zhu Jianguo affirmed the development and achievements of MCC Singapore in recent years. In the face of the current pandemic and the challenges it poses to the company, he stressed the need to \"firmly believe that both challenges and opportunities co-exist, and strive to overcome these difficulties and seek opportunities for development.\"\n\nAlong with the good news expecting Singapore to enter the third phase of reopening in a few weeks' time and anticipating an easing of restrictions on social activities, lanterns were hung up in the offices of MCC Singapore, creating a festive atmosphere. The employees of MCC Singapore gathered online from their respective workstations, offices, and homes. The employees in various project sites located in Cambodia and Indonesia also prepared traditional Chinese festive delicacies such as moon cakes and carried out activities online. As the winner of last year's competition, Mojumder Bakul kicked off this year's annual company event, MCC Voice, with exotic Bengali songs sung from the worker's dormitories in Kranji.\n\nIn light of the current pandemic, there were no fancy stages or audiences cheering below the stage for this year's MCC Voice, but it was still fun in another kind of way. Participants from various overseas projects, of different nationalities and cultural backgrounds acted as 'anchor-men' in front of the camera, singing passionately. Besides the familiar Chinese songs, there were also Indonesian and Bengali songs showcasing their distinctive charms, making this year's virtual Mid-Autumn Festival celebration a special and memorable one. In addition to the spectacular MCC Voice event, the celebration was also interspersed with various traditional Chinese games such as the Lantern Riddles activity.\n\nThese various activities not only enabled the employees of MCC Singapore to put aside their busy workload but also allowed foreign employees to celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival with their family and friends in their home countries, as well as with colleagues in other overseas projects. The greetings and best wishes from home made everyone feel the warmth of their motherland. \"The green mountains that stretch from you to me share the same cloud and rain. The bright moon never separates two places in its embrace.\" Although the pandemic has temporarily prevented us from reuniting with our colleagues and loved ones in other countries, it has not ceased our communication or stopped us from caring for each other. I believe that the pandemic will soon be over, and we will meet again.\n\nMCC Singapore wishes you all the best,May you have a happy Mid-Autumn Festival and we wish you and your family good health.\n\nMay the pandemic recede for a clear autumn sky."

The completed Mandai Project will form a large wildlife ecological area, comprising of the new Bird Park, Singapore Night Safari, Singapore Zoo, Singapore River Safari, and Rainforest Park. Experts have estimated that the annual number of visitors to Mandai will exceed 10 million, twice the current number, after the completion of the Rainforest Park.\n\nAdopting a new theme park format, the design of the Mandai Rainforest Park features animal habitats with elements of adventure and play, as well as wildlife rehabilitation centers, aviaries, and camping facilities. With the emphasis on conservation and sustainability, the design seeks to create a hub for nature education and research, leading Asia's development toward a natural ecological destination.\n\nRecently, the Singapore government has announced the temporary closure of all schools and non-essential business premises due to Covid-19, and MCC Singapore has strictly followed the rules and regulations imposed by the government to close down all construction sites, with all employees to work from home. This has not compromised or affected the design work for the Mandai Rainforest Park North project. The design team will continue to press ahead with the development of the project and strive to start construction as scheduled when work resumes in May.

The plot to the east of the Canberra Link EC project site was sold in September 2019 at S$558 per square foot and 550 residential units are expected to be built.\n\nIt is also commendable that our company's bid exceeded the second-highest bid by a mere $0.95 per square feet, which demonstrated the company's astute judgment and understanding of the market. The EC site at Canberra Link is the fifth site that the company has acquired in the northern part of Singapore. As always, MCC Singapore will continue to fulfill our mission \"Transforming Lives, Inspiring Society,\" creating more beautiful homes for the urban city of Singapore.\n\nMCC Singapore\nXin Yan"

      "content": "On 19 May 2020, MCC Singapore, which was preparing for the resumption of construction in June, won the EPC contract for the Short Street Hotel project. MCC Singapore has once again broken new ground in the local construction market after winning the design and build contract for the Mandai Tropical Rainforest Park project.\n\nThe Short Street Hotel project covers an area of 2251 square meters, with a construction area of 11160 square meters, one basement level, 14 floors above ground, and a total of 528 guest rooms. The project was challenging due to the site's limited space which required demolition before construction, as well as the tight construction schedule. With the nearest building only one meter away, it required a high level of management for the site layout and the overall construction process. Besides, the complex surrounding and environment of the project, located near the MRT line and only five to six meters away from the heritage conservation area, raises new challenges. The construction plan for the excavation of the pit not only has to consider the impact on the deformation of the MRT tunnel, but also the protection of the surrounding heritage.\n\nMCC Singapore's extensive experience in working around MRT lines in previous projects, as well as the detailed analysis of the pile foundations and the corresponding treatment of possible collisions proposed in the tender scheme, won the client's approval. In addition, the project required a total construction period of 15 months for the entire project, from demolition to completion. After carefully studying the time required for each process of the entire project, the bidding team found that according to the existing structural form of the building, traditional construction methods could not meet the bidding time requirements. As a result, two construction options were submitted in the tender for the owner's choice: one based on the existing drawings, which was economical and reasonable but had a longer construction period while the other modified the structural form of the project and replaced it with a steel structure that could be constructed faster. The latter option considered the use of reverse engineering in the construction of the foundation to meet the schedule requirements. Ultimately, MCC Singapore won the tender by virtue of its rich construction experience and excellent problem-solving ability.\n\nChen Luning,\nMCC Singapore"

MCC Singapore has maintained performance growth amidst the pandemic and has also actively promoted project development and the safe resumption of work and production after the pandemic.\n\nAs an ecotourism project that has attracted much industry attention in recent years, the design and construction challenges of the Mandai Tropical Rainforest Park are mainly to protect the existing ecological environment and sustainable development of the area, with the protection of the park's flora and fauna being the top priority in all aspects of design and construction, while ensuring the park's functionality as a theme park, meeting the needs of visitors. MCC Singapore’s commitment to high standards of innovative technology in planning and construction has led to a breakthrough in the theme park industry in terms of ecologically sustainable development, and this has also strengthened the prestigious MCC theme park brand, helping to create a new masterpiece.\n\nThe completed Mandai Tropical Rainforest Park will greatly stimulate the Singapore tourism market and extend the stay of tourists in Singapore, becoming a key component of Singapore's future tourism development plans. After completion, the park will serve as a sanctuary for endangered wild animal and plant species in Southeast Asia, becoming an important hub for natural ecological education and research in Asia. The Mandai Tropical Rainforest Park, together with Resorts World Sentosa, another project whose construction MCC Singapore had participated in, will serve as the two key landmarks for Singapore’s tourism industry, adding vitality to Singapore’s economic development.\n\nMCC Singapore"

Colleagues from as far away as Cambodia demonstrated different Cambodian dumplings and festive customs.\n\nMany Singaporean employees working from home connected with their families during this event, and other employees of MCC Singapore who are working in a foreign country had a hard time holding back their tears. The event especially helped to connect Hubei staff with their families, who have a lot of concerns in this particular year.\n\nAt the end of the event, all the participants took out paper and pen and wrote down \"good health for all, MCC Singapore, keep going!\" in their own languages. More than 300 good wishes formed a beautiful scroll together, praying that the epidemic will dissipate as soon as possible, and we can reunite once again to contribute to MCC Singapore.\n\nRelevant reports will be broadcasted on CCTV news programs during the Dragon Boat Festival.\n\nChen Luning\nMCC Singapore"
